# Coffee Shop Web App

**Coffee Shop Web App** is a modern single-page application for a coffee shop, built with **React** and **Vite**. The app currently works and will continue to evolve with new features, improved UI, and API integration.

## Features

  - `/` — Home Page  
  - `/our-coffee` — Our Coffee Page  
  - `/for-your-pleasure` — For Your Pleasure Page  
- Live search and filter functionality  
- Reusable component structure  
- Data stored in `src/data/` (JSON) or fetched from an API in the future  
- Custom CSS styling (no PostCSS)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **React** — UI library  
- **React Router** — client-side routing
