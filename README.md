# Coffee Shop Web App

This is a work-in-progress web application for a coffee shop, built with **React** and **Vite**. The app features a multi-page structure with three main pages: *Home*, *Our Coffee*, and *For Your Pleasure*. It includes search and filter functionality to browse coffee products and aims to provide a modern, user-friendly experience.

## 🚧 Project Status
This project is under active development. Current features include:
- Multi-page navigation using React Router.
- Initial setup for the *Home*, *Our Coffee*, and *For Your Pleasure* pages.
- Basic search and filter components for the coffee catalog.

Future plans include:
- Enhancing the UI with Tailwind CSS or custom styles.
- Adding a shopping cart and checkout functionality.
- Implementing dynamic data fetching from an API or JSON.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Vite**: Fast build tool and development server.
- **React**: Frontend library for building UI components.
- **React Router**: For multi-page navigation.
- **CSS**: For styling (to be extended with Tailwind CSS or similar).
- **GitHub**: For version control and collaboration.
